**[Nerve Armor Reviews](https://nerve-armor.blogspot.com/2025/02/nerve-armor-boost-nerve-function-reduce.html) :** Do you suffer from neuropathy? This debilitating disease causes burning and tingling sensations in your arms, hands, legs, and feet. The disease progresses into excruciating pain symptoms and can leave the patient requiring amputation or end up paralyzing them as their nervous system shuts down.

Doctors treat neuropathy using dangerous drugs like anticonvulsant medications and Gabapentin. Unfortunately, these drugs have severe side effects that further ruin your quality of life. However, patients continue with them because they want to avoid the risk of paralysis or amputation.

Benjamin Marsh is the mind behind the [Nerve Armor](https://nervearmor.omeka.net/) formula. He’s a former sergeant in the U.S. Military and a neuropathy patient. Ben’s neuropathy was so severe he decided to take matters into his own hands to find a solution after the drugs his doctor prescribed him did nothing to resolve his neuropathy.

Neurites are tiny branches connecting the nerves and carry electrical signals to the sensory and motor nerves. When inflammatory enzymes attack neurites, it leads to the onset of neuropathy symptoms. Nerve Armor regrows neurites, reversing the disorder to leave you pain-free.

**Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) :** PEA is a naturally occurring compound recognized for its potent pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects. Studies suggest that PEA plays a crucial role in regulating the body's pain response and mitigating inflammation. Here’s why it’s a fundamental ingredient in Nerve Armor:

- Provides Effective Pain Relief – PEA works with the endocannabinoid system to help manage persistent pain conditions.
- Boosts Mood and Reduces Anxiety – By stimulating endocannabinoid release, PEA supports mental wellness.
- Passes Through the Blood-Brain Barrier – This enables PEA to work directly on the central nervous system, increasing its effectiveness.

**Corydalis Powder (Rhizome) :** Extracted from the rhizome of the Corydalis plant, this herbal remedy has been valued in traditional medicine for its analgesic and calming effects. The key bioactive compound dehydrocorybulbine (DHCB) contributes significantly to its pain-relieving potential.

- Disrupts Pain Transmission – Corydalis inhibits pain pathways within the nervous system, providing relief from nerve discomfort.
- Non-Addictive Pain Management – Unlike synthetic pain relievers, Corydalis provides relief without dependency risks.
- Encourages Relaxation – Its mild sedative effect promotes better sleep and relaxation for those dealing with nerve pain.

**Gotu Kola Powder (Centella Asiatica) :** Gotu Kola is a revered herb known for its cognitive and circulatory benefits. Its impact on nerve health is attributed to its rich content of triterpenoid compounds.

- Enhances Blood Circulation – Improves the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to nerve cells.
- Supports Cognitive Health – Helps improve memory, focus, and mental clarity.
- Stimulates Collagen Production – Strengthens blood vessels to support nerve repair and function.

**Granular Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) :** ALA is a powerful antioxidant with significant benefits for nerve function and metabolic health.

- Aids in Nerve Regeneration – Enhances nerve conduction speed and aids in repairing damaged nerves.
- Alleviates Neuropathy Symptoms – Research shows ALA helps relieve pain, tingling, and burning associated with nerve damage.
- Supports Insulin Sensitivity – Helps regulate blood sugar levels, particularly beneficial for diabetics.

**Benfotiamine :** A highly bioavailable derivative of vitamin B1, benfotiamine plays a key role in nerve protection and oxidative stress reduction.

- Optimizes Glucose Metabolism – Prevents high blood sugar from damaging nerve cells.
- Protects Against Nerve Degeneration – Shields nerves from oxidative stress that contributes to neuropathy.
- Enhances Blood Flow to Nerves – Ensures nerve tissues receive the essential nutrients and oxygen needed for proper function.

## **How does Nerve Armor works ?**

Nerve Armor functions by addressing inflammation and pain at their origin. A primary ingredient, turmeric, is recognized for its powerful anti-inflammatory effects, which aid in diminishing swelling and alleviating discomfort associated with conditions such as arthritis or muscle strains. By tackling inflammation, Nerve Armor promotes the restoration of normal joint function and mobility, enabling you to move more freely without pain.

Another important ingredient is alpha-lipoic acid, which plays a crucial role in combating nerve pain and aiding the regeneration of damaged nerve tissue. This component operates at the cellular level, fostering improved circulation and minimizing oxidative stress—both vital for pain relief. Furthermore, Coenzyme Q10 and L-Carnitine significantly contribute to boosting cellular energy, helping to lessen muscle fatigue and enhance overall energy.

Additionally, Nerve Armor includes butcher’s broom, an herbal solution frequently utilized for chronic venous insufficiency. This ingredient aids in reducing swelling and enhancing blood flow, further facilitating mobility and alleviating discomfort in the legs and lower back. By promoting improved circulation and diminishing inflammation, the supplement takes a comprehensive approach to support long-term pain relief.
